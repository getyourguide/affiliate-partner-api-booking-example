# GetYourGuide Partner API Booking Example

To run the script:

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (current version 6) is installed.
2. Run `npm install` from the project root.
3. Run `index.js` from the project root and pass a shopping cart hash, `node index 123456789`.

The script connects to the partner test system. Bookings can be made, as the system's database gets reset periodically. All emails are blocked, so no confirmatiom message will be sent.
